[#](http://ailized.com#about=1) This project, [Ailized.com](http://ailized.com) (***p***ersonalized ***a***rtificial ***i***ntelligence), will start with the writing of a book [here](http://ailized.com#book) with the [feedback](https://ailized.com#feedback) of the internet about how we should approach the implementation of artificial intelligence for it to have a massive positive impact on humanity. After the book is finished and published (a professional writer will be hired to edit it before publishing it), the project will implement what is in the book. 

[#](http://ailized.com#about=2) The book will be written from the point of view of an AI assistant named Liz (ai***Liz***ed.com) that will explain to its owner what it can do. The difference between Liz in the book and Liz in real life will be that the interaction with the latter will be interactive.

[#](http://ailized.com#about=3) The background of ailized.com is an interactive 3D environment. A 3d button [▶](https://ailized.com#about=3&3d=1)<!--{"cone":{}}--> in the middle of a text, if pressed, will change the background to reflect the idea in the text. Pressed again will load the default background. In the book the 3d buttons will become links to images that are screenshots of the background.

[#](http://ailized.com#about=5) Each paragraph has a bullet in front of it. Pressing it will mark the paragraph as read and the bullet invisible. Bullet visibility is intended to show you when new content is added or when current content has been modified. The bullet is also the link to the paragraph, pressing it (even when it's not visible) will display the link in your browser's address bar.

[#](http://ailized.com#about=6) Ailized.com’s interface is inspired from its plans for the future where its operating system is an artificial neural network. When the project has matured enough the first ailized.com AI assistant (robot) will be built.

[#](http://ailized.com#about=7) Liz the AI assistant will “post” on social media using the style of animation found on the website's background. The owner of ailized.com originally wanted him to post on social media, but the cringe was too real, so he chose to pitch his ideas through Liz instead. It's even better that way, the content is a lot more fun and dreamier. You will know the owner when more people will get involved in the project.

[#](http://ailized.com#about=8) This approach of writing the book with the help of the Internet was chosen to increase the chances of implementing what is in the book because the more people who know about a plan the more likely it will be implemented. Other people can be collaborators, employers, investors, friends in the field, fans of the project, etc.
