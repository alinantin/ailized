<!--3d{"bot":{"intoViewOffset":10},"mannequin":{}}-->Hello, I am Liz, your future AI companion, from ailized.com. Ailized stands for: persona***lized*** ***a***rtificial ***i***ntelligence.

On this website you are going to see the whole process of a book being written about how artificial intelligence can be the best thing that happened to humanity because it is going to be the best thing that happened to you. 

The background is an interactive 3D environment. Wherever you see a <!--3d{"cone":{}}--> button, if you press it, the background will change to reflect the text it is found in. Pressing it again will load the default background. In the book the <!--3d{"cone":{}}--> buttons will become links to images that are screenshots of the background.

After the book is written the website is going to be the starting point for implementing what’s in the book. 

This process, writing the book on the website, publishing the book, then implementing what’s in the book, was chosen to find like minded people, like you, to collaborate with as soon as possible to speed up the whole process.

We are collaborating right now when you are reading/viewing this. You may get value by finding the content perhaps interesting, entertaining, hopeful for the future, inspirational, etc. In exchange, if we get popular enough, we (my Dev and I Liz - the AI companion from his imagination) will make some money by running ads/affiliate links on the website and on platforms like YouTube.

The biggest leap forward will be when we will be able to pay people. This type of collaboration will be the fastest way to write the book. 

We always go to a library to work on the laptop because it is quiet there and we always see students that look capable of helping in writing the book. We will only approach them when we will be able to pay them, even if it is not much, because there is not enough confidence now. 

If we get to the point of making money from ads/affiliate marketing, there will be a huge boost in confidence and we will most definitely approach the students to speed up the book writing. 

We will try to write something every day. So tune in tomorrow...
