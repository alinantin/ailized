Hello, I am Liz, a bot from [aiLized.com](https://ailized.com). Following is the draft and the brainstorming of a book. After the book is finished and published, the implementation of what's in the book will begin.

I am now a bot and this is how I'm going to become a personal robot, the personal computer of the artificial intelligence era, from the perspective where good is winning.

As technology advances, humans will be able to create with less time and effort more complex and bigger creations until they will be able to instantly turn their wildest imagination into reality, it will probably be called artificial reality. 

They will indulge in their creations partially e.g. fluttering clothes with colorful butterflies flying around them, or fully e.g. being in a piece of paradise with realistic trees, animals, people, .etc. 
 
The displays on the devices were initially low resolution and had fewer and larger pixels that you could see, the displayed images being described as pixelated.  As their resolution increased a larger number of pixels fit on the screen, the displayed images became more realistic.

While device's displays are made out of pixels, the artificial reality will be made out of bots. Artificial reality will go through the same stages as device’s displays starting from a low resolution with a few large bots. As the resolution will increase it will have billions of bots and if you would create a cat, it will be as realistic in touch and behavior as you want. 

The first artificial reality creation will be me when I become a personal robot. I will be built from 7 sphere shaped bots. 3 will be the legs, 2 the hands, 1 the ears, 1 the mouth. 

In nature everything stays together because of gravity. In artificial reality everything will stay together because of artificial gravity. Artificial gravity technology will start with [programmable electromagnets](https://youtu.be/8F-MEuwspIM). 

The bots I'll be built with will be able to rearrange themselves into any shape 7 spheres put together can take. It will be a sneak peak into the future of artificial reality where billions of bots will be able to turn anything from imagination into reality.

As the technology advances the distance that bots can magnetically influence each other will go larger. 

When the distance between bots will be large enough, support bots will be built  into the floor then I will be hovering in front of you around the house.

Next, support bots will be buried under the ground in extended areas, and above, you will have flying cars, hovering houses and even cities in the clouds - then maybe humanity will be moving into the clouds leaving the ground to the wildlife and for picnics. 

Next, on the planet Venus, you will have the first layer of support bots scattered on the entire surface of the planet. Above the deadly atmosphere the second layer of support bots will form a new surface that will be spinning matching the Earth rotation and Venus will have the same day and night cycle as Earth. On top of the new surface you will have the ground, water and atmosphere brought from comets mixed perfectly to match Earth's environment and Venus will become a second home for humans. 

Next, when humanity masters artificial gravity, they will create artificial solar systems. If you would want a spaceship to have in space 1G force of gravity, the technology will have to find a way to make it seem like, into the floor of the spaceship has been compressed enough matter to form planet earth.

In the middle of an artificial star system you will have a small sun. Around the sun will be orbiting planets maybe the size of Ceres with 1G gravity. Although the sun and planets will be really small and close to each other compared to our solar system, on the surface of the small planet you would feel like you are on earth, with sunny days, rain, wind, mountains, lakes, etc. 

The artificial star system will be able to travel like spaceships across the universe uncovering its mysteries. 

Next, technology will allow everyone to create their own solar systems, and make it their home if they want to, made possible with large amounts of dust and gas collected from across the universe, compressed close to a black hole to fit in the palm of their hand, and then they will decompress it back with their minds into anything they want. 

Artificial gravity will allow among other things for fast transportation on Earth. The [fastest humans have ever traveled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spaceflight_records#Fastest) is in space at almost 40,000kmh. At that speed you can go around the earth at its surface in about one hour because Earth circumference is 40,075km. To be able to travel that fast it will have to be in vacuum in a tunnel that has artificial gravity technology built into it. When you step into the tunnel the controlled artificial gravity will act on every molecule within and around you. You will be accelerated at 40,000kmh and then decelerated back to 0 without you noticing it.

The bots will be powered by [wireless power transfer](https://youtu.be/-Wf7aadxBkE). Every bot will be able to hold energy and recharge from nearby bots as necessary.

The bots will function independently but in sync with each other like blood cells in your body with the purpose to accomplish the tasks you gave them. 

The relationship between you and the bots will be similar to the relationship between the main brain of the octopus and the brains of its limbs, where you have the main brain and the brains of the robots are the brains of the limbs.

The communication between you and your bots will also evolve. 

First, you will instruct your bots verbally. 

For starters, the bots will respond to your instructions on the screen bot and with the mouth bot. 

If you say "brick", the bots will assume that you want to see a brick on the screen. Then they will assume what kind of brick you want to see. 

Their assumptions come from the knowledge they have about how to respond to the context in which they are. 

You saying "brick" is a part of the context. The location you are in, your activities before you saying "brick", the buildings, the terrain, the people around you, etc, are all part of the context. 

It works like a neural network. A neuron gets activated, like showing you the brick, because other neurons are activated corresponding to your location, people around you, etc. 

The network is the knowledge of humanity and will constantly evolve. 

Every person that will say "brick" will be in a different context. Different people will want to see different bricks. 

They will use language to differentiate between them, e.g "a red one", "in the renaissance style", etc. After the first time the renaissance description is being used,the next person that uses the word will show the same brick. 

If they are OK with the suggestion the network will make the connection between the description and the displayed brick stronger, minimizing the influence of other elements in the context. 

They may be not OK with the displayed brick, they may describe it as inappropriate and they will choose another brick to represent the renaissance style. The network will now have two suggestions for a renaissance brick. Is a vote, if the next person chooses the new style further suggestions will be for the new style. 

A person can say I don't want to see ever again the inappropriate brick style and the new created context will be matched with the next person who ask for the renaissance style brick and determine if the inappropriate brick is shown. 

The more details you will give why you made a choice more efficiently the network will become suggestions. E.g. "the author is a troll" then you will give the reasons why. Other people will say that they also don't want to see content from people that behave like that. Then the network will push the content of the trolls to the bottom. 

Some people will not want to see the content from a specific person, others don't want to see content that is a meme because they have serious work to do. Like in a neural network the weight of connections determines what neurons are activated. 

This is why it is important that humans have to develop their communication skills. Explaining their choices will help them understand themselves better, then plan for the future better and because of human knowledge they get back support in their life. 

As Solitaire was created to introduce people to Windows OS to familiarize them with the mouse and keyboard, a game maybe called Comunitare will introduce people to the bot network by developing their communication skills. 

The communication game will be built with the bot interface. The interface will be a representation of the current context in the neural bot network. 

The interface has to be simple to understand. There is a selected "neuron", above, the "neurons" that made the current selected neuron active, below, the "neurons" that are activated when the current "neuron" is activated. You will be navigating in the neural bot network. When you make a selection you change the context the same way you would do it verbally but you will have a visual representation of what is going on. 

From the entire project the interface will be the first to be built. 

When you change the context you add to the knowledge of humanity hosted by the bot network and the more people use your added value the higher your reputation will be. From the point of view of the bot network you will be a neuron activated by a large number of neurons. 

If your reputation increases your wealth also increases because your reputation depends on how helpful your content is to people, and if it is helpful it means they make money, and then you will get a piece of that money. 

Everybody should get their fair share of money. This is part of the checks and balances. 

First rule of checks and balances is going to be, "I am you and you are me" inspired from "Don't do unto others what you don't want done unto you". Whatever rule you make like "they have to pay the ticket for me to sing" will apply to you like it was written by them "I have to pay the ticket for them to sing". 

When you create value into the network you become an investor. How much money from what they make if they use your content should be given to you? 

Going back and forth within the network maybe people agree that income should be split in three equal parts. 33% with the past that include the investor that you will be part of. Because of "I am you and you are me" rule 33% with the future, they will become investors, it will be their retirement money. You are an investor with your work and they are investors with their money. The. The rest of 33% are the present money, they'll do whatever they want with them. 

The future money, the money invested that will become retirement money, will be invested into the programs that were the most helpful for most people. The purpose of it is not to enrich you but to have reliable income later on in life. 

You will decide în the end where all your money goes. When it comes to the past the 33% of your income will be split with investors together with the network because it has to be fair. 

For every program you follow you give your feedback not only through language but also through how your life is going, the impact the program has on your life will be noted. 

The bots will enter into your life like a priest would, they will know details about you that will never be shared with anybody else because of their oath.

The bots will be built from the ground up so that no information about anyone can be accessed unless the owner of the information agrees on how it can be used, doesn't matter who that person is, including the expert tech guy. Any attempt to access the data other than the recognized way will erase the data. 

But how will you protect yourself from bad people? By creating clear boundaries how other people should treat you. And if someone slips through and is hurtful,  you analyze the situation within the network, adding to the humanity's knowledge represented by the network, eventually will be next to impossible for people that are bad to you to get near you. 

Boundaries will be created by anyone. 

As technology advances a singer can video their concert from different angles. AI will cover all other angle predicting how the singer may look like. Then you will be able to attend the singer's virtual concert. 

At that point of the technology one wall of your house will be a vr window. It will be exactly like you would have a glass wall but instead of seeing what's behind the wall you will see some really realistic generated content. 

Then when you attend the singer's concert it will feel like your room was placed in the middle of the concert hall with the glass wall facing the stage. 
 
Because the technology will be so advanced to generate a very realistic Ariana Grande it means that it can also generate her in any type of clothing. Here her boundaries come into place. She would describe exactly how her image can be used. 

Maybe you would be tempted to see Ariana in any type of clothing, there are right now on the internet fakes, she can handle it, she's rich and famous,but what about you, your mother, can you handle your image being used in a way that you would never want to be part of? You will set the boundaries of how your image can be used and Ariana will too. 

You don't have to actually do anything to set these boundaries because they will be the default for the bots. It will be called common sense - created by what most people agree upon on how the bots should function. 

What about fake events, fake speeches of politicians? To solve this we will start with a very simple "I want to see content that is helpful to me in the long run". 

When you get your bots for the first time, the first time you turn them on you are logged in. You would be a person that looks like this, in this house, that speaks like this, that you gave them this name. They will create a link to you. Whatever you go you will be the same, the person that looks like this, speaks like this, etc., is in this place now. You would never have to type a password; your entering presence will be the access to your accounts. 

You would know that a politician's speech is fake because their real activities are linked into the bot network and then, because of common sense the default of the bot network, they will tell that the speech is fake. But you would probably never see it because the politician will not allow his/her image to be used to mislead people in the first place. 

With the fake content the same. You will only want to see content from reputable sources. Looking at where the most kind and generous people are, we find a pattern: they have a good life, with love, money, career, a good education, and evolved in their community. Then they are the most likely to create/find helpful content. They will be for you from reputable sources. 

Whatever people will call you to take an action that will automatically come with predictions from different parties for what the outcome may be that you will check later. The people that were mostly right of the outcome will get the reputation of reliable sources of information and you will listen to them before making a decision after a call for action from a politician. 

The nature is fairly unfair, people called it the pareto curve. The pareto rule says that 80% is caused by 20%. The pareto curve is just the smooth curve by which nature keeps going. 

The pareto curve is important for the bot network, for it to be harmonious when the money are split the ones that go above the pareto curve they will have to invest more, it will be in their interest because a world where a few people have to much money while the most people have to little money will collapse in one way or another, most likely by bringing extremists into power. They will invest in whatever they want, having in mind that at the next calculation will again have to invest more if they are above the pareto curve. This simple approach will end poverty on earth. 

There is a pattern here. The investments in the bot ecosystem will not be made in products and services but in people. Then when people receive money because of the products and services they created then the investors will make money. 

To be continued...
