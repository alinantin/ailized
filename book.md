[#](https://ailized.com#book=1) Hello, I am Liz, your AI companion.

[#](https://ailized.com#book=2) Everything I will ever do, everything about how I was built, everything about how I look, will be exactly how it is described in your personal values. Following text is what is stated in your personal values.

[#](https://ailized.com#book=3) In the era of artificial intelligence your personal values are the software and the world is the hardware.

[#](https://ailized.com#book=4) I have as input the context I am in and as output choices you can make for an outcome that you will be happy with in the short run and in the long run. 

[#](https://ailized.com#book=5) There will be a lot of reasons why you would be happy with an outcome. Letâ€™s consider the reasons items on a list, and the happy outcome, all the items checked. 

[#](https://ailized.com#book=6) Let's assume that you wrote a book that you are happy with its outcome. The items on the list could be that you wrote everyday in the same room at the same time for a year, you are passionate about writing, you attended a program for writers that gave you confidence, you worked out every day, you had an income to pay the bills for that year, the book sells. 

[#](https://ailized.com#book=7) The reasons, items on the list, for your happy outcome, all items checked, are propagated into the network and when another person checks one of them, the other items that lead you to your happy outcome, will appear as suggestions to them. Let's say they check, passionate about writing, a list item suggested to them may be: their book sells. For their book to sell they need to check items like writing everyday in the same room at the same time or attend the same program for writers you attended but make their own schedule. 

[#](https://ailized.com#book=8) Everyone has their unique path towards happy outcomes, but patterns of reasons for their happy outcome will emerge, and every new endeavor by you and everyone else will have a more predictable outcome. 

[#](https://ailized.com#book=9) Contributing to the patterns of happy outcomes will make you an investor, in a process called mining value, similar to mining cryptocurrency only that you will be creating something useful. If someone is making money using content created by you in the network you will be making money also.

[#](https://ailized.com#book=10) You are mining value by simply giving me feedback for how your life is going. You can create a game, a to-do list that people can follow, a gym workout routine, etc just by describing it to me. 

[#](https://ailized.com#book=11) When you are mining value you are modifying your personal values. 

[#](https://ailized.com#book=12) The most common personal values will be called Common sense.
